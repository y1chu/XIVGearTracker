# FFXIV Raid Gear Tracker

FFXIV Raid Gear Tracker is a web application designed to help teams in Final Fantasy XIV track their raid gear. It allows users to enter the gear of each member in their raid team and stores the data locally in their browser, which can be retrieved using a recovery password.

## Features
- Enter gear for up to 8 members.
- Specify gear types and whether they are obtained.
- Data is saved locally and can be recovered using a password.
- Colored blocks for different roles (Blue for Tanks, Green for Healers, and Red for DPS).

## How to Use

1. Go to the [GitHub Pages site for FFXIV Raid Gear Tracker](https://your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name/).
2. You will see a grid with 8 members (Main Tank, Off Tank, Healer 1, Healer 2, DPS1, DPS2, DPS3, DPS4).
3. For each member, choose gear types and specify whether each piece of gear has been obtained.
4. Once all data is entered, click the Submit button. A recovery password will be generated.
5. The recovery password will be automatically copied to your clipboard. Save this password in a safe place. You will need it to recover your data in the future.
6. To recover your data, enter the recovery password in the Recovery Password field and click the Recover button.
